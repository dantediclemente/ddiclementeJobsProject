## Command to run tests
- `python -m pytest`

## Description
- This project grabs data from the github jobs api and then stores the json objects in a text file. 

## Testing
- There are two automated tests. 
  - The first checks that the method returns over 100 data items.
  - The second test checks that the correct data is being pulled. It checks that a known company name is present in the text file that was created from the previous method.
