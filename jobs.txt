As an interdisciplinary team we focus on integrating mobility service providers for car- sharing, scooters, bike-sharing and ride-hailing such as car2go, TIER or FREE NOW (formerly mytaxi) into our urban mobility platform.

We\u2019re looking for a backend-focused engineer (d/f/m) to join our squad.</p>\n<h2><strong>FIRST A QUICK LOOK AT US</strong></h2>\n<p>Daimler AG and BMW Group are bundling their mobility services in the areas of Carsharing, Ride-Hailing, Parking, Charging and Multimodal Platforms, and create a new global player comprising of five joint ventures. moovel Group is joining forces with ReachNow - and becomes REACH NOW</p>\n<p>Our vision is a planet without traffic jams. Our mission is to transform cities by providing the most convenient and sustainable mobility solutions. We create outstanding products with technical excellence, an agile mindset, an open feedback and failure culture and fun at work. moovel is part of two large global corporations, but at the heart of it we still are a start-up. We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 150 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at three locations - Hamburg, Berlin, and Portland.</p>\n<h2><strong>HOW THE ROLE WORKS</strong></h2>\n<p>We are building services that provide a fully fledged feature set of urban mobility service providers. Our backend enables the moovel mobility app to find nearby mobility options like car or bike-sharing as well as scooters and ride-hailing services. It also allows booking functionality and handles payment.\nOur services interact with moovel\u2019s mobility platform as well as external APIs. Many of our services are also exposed to external partners, so they have to be well documented, stable and easy to use. Implementing new services in a consistent way is also very important to us.</p>\n<h2><strong>SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Work in the mobility core &amp; services (MCS) squad together with other backend engineers, mobile engineers, QA engineers and designers</li>\n<li>Build microservices with Node.js written in TypeScript and deployed on AWS</li>\n<li>Design and implement APIs for discovering mobility points, booking flows and payment for mobility services.</li>\n<li>Integrate APIs from third-party mobility service providers into our platform.</li>\n<li>As we follow agile principles, you will participate in defining our products and building them.

We believe in hiring great engineers, not programming language experts.</li>\n<li>You know how to operate services in production: deploying, performance monitoring, tracing problems, and optimization are part of the things you have done in the past</li>\n<li>We run our services on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and monitor them with New Relic. Knowledge with those technologies is a plus, but not mandatory.</li>\n<li>You are able to communicate verbally and written in English (we communicate mostly in English).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>BENEFITS</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose your own hardware</li>\n<li>Working with newest technologies &amp; microservices</li>\n<li>Company pension plan</li>\n<li>Weekly breakfast, coffee &amp; fresh fruits</li>\n<li>Monthly mobility budget</li>\n<li>Be part of an interdisciplinary team of experts</li>\n<li>Working on products with a high impact on society</li>\n<li>International teams</li>\n<li>Child care allowance</li>\n<li>Flexible working hours</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If this caught your attention, then we can not wait to meet you soon!

    "description": "<p><strong>Ben jij een kei in je vak en vind je het ook leuk om jouw kennis over te dragen en je team te coachen? En wil jij, net als wij, niets liever dan gave online oplossingen ontwikkelen voor aansprekende klanten?</strong></p>\n<p>Axendo heeft voor haar locatie in Leusden (bij Amersfoort) een vacature voor een</p>\n<p><strong>Senior Front-End Developer</strong>\nvoor 32-40 uur</p>\n<p><strong>Wat ga je doen als Front-End Developer?</strong>\nVanuit jouw ervaring begeleid je front-end collega's bij het uitvoeren van hun werkzaamheden. Je vindt het leuk om over jouw vakgebied zaken duidelijk uit te leggen aan anderen in het development team.</p>\n<p>Uiteenlopende projecten liggen voor je klaar om samen met je collega\u2019s in sprints opgepakt te worden. Jij zorgt als front-end developer voor de verbinding tussen het design en de techniek. Je onderzoekt, ontwerpt, ontwikkelt en implementeert. Je bent daarnaast de vraagbaak als het gaat om wat precies goed werkt op het gebied van gebruiksvriendelijkheid en toegankelijkheid.</p>\n<p><strong>Wat jou uniek maakt</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We zoeken een slimme developer met circa 5 jaar werkervaring</li>\n<li>Het geeft je energie om mensen op een coachende wijze naar een hoger plan te tillen</li>\n<li>Je hebt gedegen kennis van HTML, CSS precompilers, Javascript, BEM en Gulp/NPM. Het is mooi als je ook ervaring hebt met Javascript frameworks zoals React of Vue.js.</li>\n<li>Als je kennis hebt van WCAG, SEO of UX/UI, dan heb je een streepje voor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Wat biedt Axendo jou?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Een salaris van 3.000 tot 4.500 Euro bruto per maand. Inschaling vindt plaats op basis van jouw ervaring.</li>\n<li>Intentie voor een vast dienstverband vanaf de start.</li>\n<li>Flexibiliteit qua werktijden en thuiswerken \u00e9n qua arbeidsvoorwaarden (we overleggen samen wat wenselijk en realistisch is) Ons kantoor is goed bereikbaar en centraal gelegen bij Amersfoort, vlakbij de A28 en de A1.</li>\n<li>Een fijne-, ruime werkplek, pensioen, reiskostenvergoeding, een persoonlijk opleidingsbudget, een snelle laptop met twee of meer schermen, lekkere koffie, gratis parkeren voor de deur en iedere dag een geheel verzorgde lunch vinden wij vanzelfsprekend.</li>\n<li>Een hecht, gezellig en professioneel team van 15 collega\u2019s en wij werken agile.</li>\n<li>Circa 4 keer per jaar leuke teamuitjes, waaronder bijvoorbeeld een uitgebreid kerstdiner met partner. Daarnaast gaan we ook geregeld met elkaar en met klanten o.a. voetballen, curlen en squashen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Over Axendo</strong>\nGoed werkgeverschap betekent voor ons op de eerste plaats vooral een persoonlijke benadering. Wij vinden het heel belangrijk dat jij helemaal jezelf kunt zijn en lekker in je vel zit. Zo krijg je bij ons alle ruimte om je verder te ontwikkelen door bijvoorbeeld het bijwonen van interessante meetups, congressen, kennissessies en/of het volgen van relevante trainingen/opleidingen. Bovendien kun je rekenen op veel vrijheid en eigen verantwoordelijkheid. We zijn nuchter, innovatief, werken in een open cultuur, hebben zeer korte lijnen en leren graag van elkaar. Plezier op en in je werk staat bij ons hoog in het vaandel, zo spelen we graag in de pauze een potje FIFA, maken een wandeling uitgestippeld door Pok\u00e9mon GO of nemen de laatste zelfgemaakte speciaalbieren door (tijdens onze vrijdagmiddagborrels \ud83d\ude09).</p>\n<p><strong>Wie zijn wij</strong>\nEen digitaal bureau dat bestaat uit specialisten die trots zijn op hun vak. We maken graag mooie dingen die voor gebruikers gewoon werken. Simpel als resultaat. Met de weg er naartoe soms moeilijk, dat is onze uitdaging!</p>\n<p>Het in hechte, multidisciplinaire teams  bouwen aan de best schaalbare online platformen voor grote groepen gebruikers, dat is onze kracht. Waarbij we altijd rekening houden met de diversiteit aan mensen die deze platformen (gaan) gebruiken. Of ze nou (kleuren-)blind zijn of moeite hebben met lezen. Zo werken wij o.a. met veel trots voor iamsterdam.com, JINC, HandicapNL, het Watersportverbond en niet te vergeten de RET.</p>\n",

We\u2019ve got a challenge you can really sink your teeth into.</p>\n<h2>Making a difference</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Depending on your experience and skills, you will build, test, develop and/or validate comprehensive risk models that support the bank\u2019s ambitions and safeguard our customers</li>\n<li>Think here of mathematical, data-driven credit risk models</li>\n<li>You will work closely with colleagues and stakeholders of all nationalities to solve highly complex challenges and establish workable models that the bank can put into practice</li>\n<li>You\u2019ll work intensely with a variety of stakeholders, including Risk Management, Finance and external regulators (like DNB and ECB), IT and more</li>\n<li>So in addition to putting your modelling skills to the test, we\u2019ll also ask you to contribute to the team dynamic in a positive way</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your technology stack consists of Python, Matlab, SQL and GIT, or comparable packages and programming languages.</p>\n<h2>With each other</h2>\n<p>Collaboration is at the heart of everything we do. We bring teams of talented people together to develop the next generation of risk models that not only thrill our regulators, but also drive our business forward. Both Risk Modelling (ALM &amp; Credit) and Model Validation operate in an open atmosphere of collaboration and service. We know that no one can solve the complex challenges of risk modelling on her/his own. It takes a well-rounded team of experienced professionals who are willing to look beyond their own accomplishments and work together to achieve a common objective. Whether it\u2019s safeguarding Rabobank\u2019s \u20ac200 billion mortgage portfolio, or calculating the risk-reward ratio of a large multi-national wholesale client, you will play a key role in processes that affect nearly every aspect of the bank\u2019s business.\nWith you as a Risk Modeler, you will strike a balance between strong leadership and open collaboration, with team members like:</p>\n<p>Maikel, Team Lead IFRS9: \u201cNo one can solve the complex issues of modelling alone. That\u2019s why the team works closely together to contribute to the overall result. You won\u2019t ever hear \u2018that\u2019s not my job\u2019. Much more often, you\u2019ll hear, \u2018how can I help?\u2019 The person who leads this team should not be afraid to get her/his hands dirty. Every member of the team contributes. There are no ivory towers.\u201d</p>\n<h2>With you</h2>\n<p>If we were to ask your friends to describe you in a few key words, the answer would be: customer-focused, confident, and able to take on challenges with confidence and flexibility.\nWe\u2019re searching for Credit Risk Modelers of all levels, but particularly mid- and senior-level analysts.

We are working on enlarging the team to open 4 more countries by 2020 first quarter.</p>\n<p>The company is self-funded, we have been in the market for five years now and we\u2019ve been profitable all the way. This is the result of passion for web development and care for our customers.</p>\n<h2>Project</h2>\n<p>The project consists mainly on a custom made (PHP/JS) social network, using WordPress as the core for content management. Customers are able to create and manage accounts like they would on a site like Instagram.</p>\n<p>Plus a few other extra functionalities, not only for customers but for customer service and admins as well.</p>\n<h3>Scope</h3>\n<p>While there are a lot of front end needs, most of the work will happen on the back end and private administrative sections.</p>\n<p>The system is broken down into 18 modules, each as its own WordPress plugin.</p>\n<p>We also rely on third party plugins for things such as image optimization, load speed and performance, cronjob handling, and the likes.</p>\n<p>Our own theme handles mostly page templates and CSS.</p>\n<p>The system is highly configurable and ready to be installed on different countries with different use cases.</p>\n<p>We also have integrations with third parties for SMS notifications, and payment processing.</p>\n<h3>Developer Job Responsibilities</h3>\n<p>You will be taking the lead developer role in our company to replace our founder (me).</p>\n<p>Besides keeping and eye over everything you\u2019ll be improving existing features as well as creating new ones from start to finish.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also be helping us professionalizing things. The code is not the best, some things are rushed or patched. There isn\u2019t any documentation explaining how the system works or which function does what. With time this may even result in re-designing and re-writing big chunks of code.</p>\n<p>Expect to be spending some time learning how things work (of course you will have guidance along the way).</p>\n<p>When the work load deserves it, we can talk about hiring junior devs to work with you.</p>\n<h3>Developer Job Duties</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The position requires constant communication with colleagues.</li>\n<li>Expertise and hands on experience with software development is needed to be successful in this position</li>\n<li>Must be willing to learn LAMP and WordPress.</li>\n<li>Strong grasp of CSS3.</li>\n<li>Regular exposure to company management, as well as the authority and scope to apply your expertise to many interesting technical problems.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Your application</h2>\n<p>This is one of the most important roles in our company. If you\u2019re ready to handle the responsibility and you\u2019re passionate about building platforms for people to use, we\u2019re waiting for you!</p>\n<h3>Summary or cover letter</h3>\n<p>Please lead with a couple sentences introducing yourself.</p>\n<p>Explain why you want the role, why are you applying for it?</p>\n<p>Go through each requirement and explain how you meet the requirement.</p>\n<h3>Please don\u2019t list every technology you have ever come across, instead list the specific skills that apply to this job</h3>\n<p>The technologies you have used should be incorporated into the summary and career history as long as it\u2019s relevant.</p>\n<h3>Github, Bitbucket and StackOverflow accounts</h3>\n<p>If you have a Github/Bitbucket/Stackoverflow account then please list it. If you contribute to open source projects, please add them. If you have an online presence that in any way supports the role you are applying for, please make sure it\u2019s listed.</p>\n<h3>App store links or Websites you have worked on</h3>\n<p>If you have worked on mobile apps and they are any the app store, make sure you include the links to them. If you have worked on websites, include the URL\u2019s. Don\u2019t just include the links, add the specifics of exactly what you did on each project as described below.</p>\n<h3>Specific development work you actually did</h3>\n<p>Details matter. Let us know about the development work you actually did during each particular project or role.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What were you responsible for?</li>\n<li>What technologies did you use and for what purpose?</li>\n<li>Where you part of a team? Did you lead the team?</li>\n<li>What did you learn most from the role?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Section for personal interests</h3>\n<p>Listing your interests outside of work helps to flesh you out as a real person.</p>\n<p>We are also looking for someone who will enjoy working with us and enjoy taking the platform world wide.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s hundreds of thousands of sex workers out there that deserve the chance to manage their job (and their money!) on their own terms, and not what someone else dictates for them. Let\u2019s help them out : )</p>\n",

Het CBS levert als h\u00e9t statistische bureau van Nederland met betrouwbare statistische informatie en data inzicht in maatschappelijke vraagstukken. Daarmee voedt het CBS het maatschappelijk debat, de beleidsontwikkeling en de besluitvorming en draagt zo bij aan welvaart, welzijn en democratie.</p>\n<p>Het CBS werd in 1899 opgericht vanuit de behoefte aan onafhankelijke, betrouwbare informatie om maatschappelijke vraagstukken te begrijpen. Deze rol heeft het CBS nog altijd. De organisatie is inmiddels uitgegroeid tot een innovatieve kennisorganisatie, die voortdurend nieuwe technologie\u00ebn en ontwikkelingen toepast om de kwaliteit van de gegevens en de onafhankelijke positie te kunnen blijven borgen.</p>\n<h2><strong>Wat ga je doen?</strong></h2>\n<p>Je werkt aan het ambitieuze innovatieve product Information Dialogue dat alle statistische informatie van het CBS via toepassing van AI ontsluit, zodat een gebruiker precies d\u00ede informatie krijgt die hij nodig heeft. Dit doen we door een computergestuurde dialoog, zo menselijk mogelijk, te ontwikkelen die alle informatie die nu in onze open data database beschikbaar is aan te bieden. We zijn het eerste statistiekbureau in de wereld dat deze uitdaging aangaat.\nJe gaat de software ontwikkelen die de verbinding maakt tussen deze open data en de spraakrobot (bijvoorbeeld Google Assistant).\nVoor een impressie waaraan je gaat werken klik hier</p>\n<h2><strong>Wie zoeken wij</strong></h2>\n<p>Je bent een Software Engineer met kennis van C#, node.js en Xamarin waarbij kennis van AI-bots zoals Google Dialogflow (Assistent), Cortana, Alexa of Siri een pr\u00e9 is.

Daarnaast ben je bekend met de principes van Agile en Scrum. Uiteraard heb je uitstekende samenwerkingsvaardigheden.</p>\n<h2><strong>Waar kom je te werken</strong></h2>\n<p>Je komt te werken in een jong agile team dat verantwoordelijk is voor ontwikkeling van de Information Dialogue, \u00e9\u00e9n van de cutting edge innovaties die er voor zorgen dat het CBS tot \u00e9\u00e9n van de beste en meest vooruitstrevende statistiekbureaus ter wereld blijft behoren. De sfeer van dit team is die van een Start-up, met hoge ambities, grote uitdagingen en de gedrevenheid om de Information Dialogue tot een succes te maken.</p>\n<h2><strong>Aanbod</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Een salaris van minimaal \u20ac2631 en maximaal \u20ac4809 bruto per maand op basis van 36 uur. De inschaling is afhankelijk van kennis en ervaring.</li>\n<li>Een uitdagende baan in een dynamisch werkveld waar eigen verantwoordelijkheid nemen binnen passende eigen regelruimte voorop staat.</li>\n<li>Een vaste eindejaarsuitkering van 8,3%.</li>\n<li>Vakantiegeld uitkering van 8%.</li>\n<li>Flexibele werktijden en thuiswerkmogelijkheden.</li>\n<li>Voor het woon-werkverkeer ontvang je een NS Businesscard.</li>\n<li>De mogelijkheid om bij een fulltime aanstelling (36 uur) 4 uur per week compensatieverlof op te bouwen.</li>\n<li>Een studiefaciliteitenregeling.</li>\n<li>Individuele Keuzen Arbeidsvoorwaarden Pakket; de IKAP-regeling stelt je in staat om bijvoorbeeld extra vakantiedagen te kopen of te sporten met korting door middel van belastingvoordeel.</li>\n<li>Een werkplek met voldoende ruimte voor jouw persoonlijke en professionele ontwikkeling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>We zijn op zoek naar meerdere software engineers en bieden een tijdelijke aanstelling die na enige tijd kan worden omgezet in een vaste aanstelling.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Contactinformatie</strong>\nVoor inhoudelijke informatie over de functie kun je contact opnemen met Gabri\u00eblle van Mourik, telefoon 06 52464072.</p>\n<p>Voor vragen over de procedure kun je contact opnemen met Hilda Folkerts, Corporate recruiter, <a href=\"mailto:h.folkerts@cbs.nl\">h.folkerts@cbs.nl</a>, telefoon:070-3375574.</p>\n<p>De bevestiging van je sollicitatie wordt mogelijk gezien als spam.

    "description": "<p>Attention Senior Backend Developers:\n\u201cSkyrocket Your Career As A Developer In The Dream Work Environment \u2013 While Solving Interesting Problems And Working With A Clean Codebase\u201d</p>\n<p>You\u2019ve finally found it\u2026</p>\n<p>The perfect work environment to skyrocket your career as a developer.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a talented, experienced and ambitious backend developer, then this page could literally change your life!</p>\n<p>But only if you keep reading.</p>\n<p>iPhone Photography School is the world\u2019s no. 1 online photography resource. To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</p>\n<p>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.</p>\n<p>Right now, we\u2019re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</p>\n<p>To attract the most capable developers like you, we\u2019ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</p>\n<p>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</p>\n<p>1 - Solve Interesting Problems</p>\n<p>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</p>\n<p>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</p>\n<p>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we\u2019ve got automated testing for everything.</p>\n<p>The point is, you\u2019ll never be bored working here.</p>\n<p>2 - Work With A Clean Codebase</p>\n<p>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you\u2019re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are \u201cWho the **** wrote this?\u201d</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t work like that.</p>\n<p>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</p>\n<p>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</p>\n<p>3 - Endless Opportunities To Grow</p>\n<p>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you\u2019ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</p>\n<p>We get how important growth is for developers.</p>\n<p>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we\u2019ll pay for it.</p>\n<p>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We\u2019ll encourage you to do it.</p>\n<p>4 - Get Expert Guidance</p>\n<p>Our developers are ninjas. But we don\u2019t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s something outside of our team\u2019s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</p>\n<p>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</p>\n<p>Join our team, and you\u2019ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</p>\n<p>5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</p>\n<p>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already\u2026 while you had no clue it was a priority?</p>\n<p>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature \u2013 only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</p>\n<p>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they\u2019ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</p>\n<p>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</p>\n<p>6 - Work From Anywhere In The World</p>\n<p>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world \u2013 including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!</p>\n<p>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you\u2019ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</p>\n<p>7 - Stability You Can Count On</p>\n<p>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</p>\n<p>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.</p>\n<p>You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.</p>\n<p>8 - Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</p>\n<p>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</p>\n<p>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.</p>\n<p>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s What We Expect From You\u2026</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You\u2019re excellent at PHP</li>\n<li>You\u2019ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</li>\n<li>You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</li>\n<li>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</li>\n<li>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</li>\n<li>You have an excellent attention to detail</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

    "description": "<p>We are <strong><a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/\">Datawrapper</a></strong> - a <strong>web-based charting tool</strong>, and we want you to join us as a <strong>client-facing software engineer</strong> in our office in Berlin, Prenzlauer Berg.</p>\n<p>What's this exciting new position about? Well, although Datawrapper is used primarily by journalists, our customer base is growing and diversifying, and some of our users come with special requirements and challenges. We want to be able to accommodate these people as well. Enabling us to provide them with a flawless Datawrapper experience will be your job.</p>\n<h3>The kind of stuff you\u2019ll be doing:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Developing new visualization features</strong> for specific customer groups. For example, an analyst at a financial institution might need different charting features than a data journalist at a local newspaper. We work with both, so that will be part of what you're responsible for.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Building &amp; maintaining integrations</strong> with other software and tools. There are all kinds of other apps and tools that Datawrapper interacts with in the real world, like CMS\u2019s and databases. Part of your job will be ensuring that those integrations are easy to build and run smoothly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Extending Datawrapper</strong> to make sure it works well with large customer teams. When one person uses Datawrapper on their own, creating and organizing charts is pretty straight-forward. When there are hundreds of people creating charts in a large team, not so much! Ensuring that even the largest of our customers' teams don\u2019t hit any walls when using Datawrapper will be part of this job.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who we\u2019re looking for:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We\u2019re looking for a full stack web developer to join our Berlin development team, <strong>preferrably full-time</strong>, but open to flexible work time arrangements.</li>\n<li>You will have a full, regular employment contract. Due to the nature of this job, it will <strong>not be possible to do this job entirely remote</strong>. <em>Please save yourself and us some time and only apply if you want to work with us in Berlin.</em>\n</li>\n<li>On the technical side, most of the work we\u2019re doing is front end development work in <strong>JavaScript/ES6, D3.js, Bootstrap and <a href=\"https://svelte.technology/\">Svelte</a></strong>. There\u2019s a PHP and MySQL backend as well, but that won\u2019t be too much of your concern.</li>\n<li>We\u2019re looking for somebody who has worked in web development before, but you don't need to have specific experience with our tooling or choice of frameworks. <strong>We\u2019re happy to show you how our stack works.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What the \"client-facing\" part entails:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A significant part of the job will involve <strong>interacting with users and customers.</strong> be it by phone, video call or email. We encourage everybody in our company to do this, but in this role it will be particularly prevalent</li>\n<li>That means we're looking for someone with <strong>good communication, interpersonal and written skills</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Strong English skills</strong> will also be necessary, as our users and customers sit all over the world.</li>\n<li>Not a must-have, but a plus: German skills, interest in or experience with data visualization, experience working in a software company.</li>\n<li>If you have <strong>any prior work you can show us</strong>, open-source or not, please feel free to include it in your application. We'd love to take a look at it. Even if you don\u2019t, please don\u2019t feel discouraged to apply.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What we can offer:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A big desk in our office in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg</strong>, where seven of us work (<a href=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/about-us/\">Ivan, Lisa, Anna, Gregor, Elana, Hans &amp; David</a>). We have a massive library of data vis books, a coffee machine, tea en masse &amp; interesting conversations about mapping, data vis and UX. Also, we honour lunch breaks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible working hours.</strong> We're looking for someone who wants to work for us <strong>at least four days a week</strong>. There's no 9-to-5 culture in our office, though. Some people come at 11 am, some leave at 4 pm, others like to work from home from time to time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A question-happy, communication-happy atmosphere.</strong> We're all learning, and we want you to learn with us. If someone has an idea or a problem, we just talk. No meetings for most of us, a bit of Slack, lots of fun.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don't care about CVs, just skills and attitude. If you don't find yourself 100% in the description, write Lisa an email anyway. Talk a bit about yourself and how your skills &amp; experience could be a good fit for this job, and ask us aaaaall the questions you might have:</p>\n<p><strong>\u2192 <a href=\"mailto:lisa@datawrapper.de\">lisa@datawrapper.de</a></strong></p>\n<p>We're looking forward to hearing from you!</p>\n",

If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, you\u2019ll be in great company.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to leave our client teams functioning at a higher level than when we found them.  We do this by writing high quality code alongside our clients\u2019 development teams, as well as mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices.</p>\n<p>We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times. So, we approach each engagement as the unique opportunity it is.</p>\n<p><strong>As a Strider, you\u2019ll find a learning opportunity that\u2019s unmatched. You will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be part of an engineering-driven culture, one that has a 4.9 star Glassdoor review and has won Crain\u2019s -Best Places to Work 2 years in a row.</li>\n<li>Write high quality code with some of the smartest engineers in town.</li>\n<li>Immerse yourself in a learning journey that\u2019s second to none. No where else will you find the variety that being a consultant brings, all a subway ride away.</li>\n<li>Mentor and be mentored. Learning weaves a thread through all that we do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A Day In The Life of a Stride Software Engineer</strong></p>\n<p>You\u2019ll co-locate and work onsite at your client (all are in NYC). We are proud to call the most outstanding tech teams in NYC our clients, ranging from funded startups to Fortune 500.</p>\n<p>You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. Every day for every Strider is different. Here\u2019s how one day might unfold:</p>\n<p>9am: One-on-one with my manager. We grab coffee at Stumptown and talk about my career goals. I\u2019m noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager\u2019s take. We walk away with action items for next week\u2019s one-on-one.</p>\n<p>10am: Daily Standup. I\u2019m at work at the client\u2019s office. They\u2019ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I\u2019m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we\u2019re off to code.</p>\n<p>10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I\u2019m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.</p>\n<p>12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride</p>\n<p>12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride\u2019s got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I\u2019m psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.</p>\n<p>1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client\u2019s office.</p>\n<p>1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we\u2019re retrospecting our last release. I\u2019ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.</p>\n<p>2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I\u2019ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it\u2019s been a huge career learning experience for me.</p>\n<p>6pm: Leave for the Day. It\u2019s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.</p>\n<p><strong>What you\u2019ll be doing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing high quality code, and bringing a \u2018teach a team to fish\u2019 mentality to your project.</li>\n<li>Embed with development teams in some of NYC\u2019s most exciting companies to help them up their game and get stuff done.</li>\n<li>Advocate for non-dogmatic Agile software development best practices like Test Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Improvement.</li>\n<li>Be part of a cross functional team that includes Striders (likely 2-6 Strider engineers plus a product manager) and client employees (likely engineers and other tech roles).</li>\n<li>Work with a variety of tech stacks, and a see a variety of tech teams. We embed with teams who write code in modern tech stacks such as Ruby on Rails, React, Angular, Python, Scala, Java8, Elixir, Node and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>You\u2019re a fit for Stride if you have:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>3+ years of software development experience</li>\n<li>Experience in multiple programming languages</li>\n<li>Excitement to learn new languages and frameworks</li>\n<li>Experience with TDD, story estimation, test writing, and pair programming</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What you can expect from us:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continuous learning on things that you are passionate about</li>\n<li>Competitive Pay and Benefits (including Profit Sharing!)</li>\n<li>Empowerment to work at a self-defined Sustainable Pace</li>\n<li>No travel, all of our clients are located in NYC</li>\n<li>$2,000 and up to two weeks of your time for self-directed professional development</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description": "<p><strong>Job Description</strong></p>\n<p>Analytics Fire builds custom software for the solar power industry. We\u2019re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p>\n<p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We\u2019re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.\nFor reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</li>\n<li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</li>\n<li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li>\n<li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li>\n<li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li>\n<li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li>\n<li>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a remote position. We\u2019re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We\u2019re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</p>\n<p>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</p>\n<p><strong>About Analytics Fire</strong></p>\n<p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. Our dream is to be able to spend our time working on interesting problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.\u201d</p>\n",
